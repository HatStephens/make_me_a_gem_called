# MakeMeAGemCalled

Having followed a tutorial by Matt Huggins on quickleft.com, I have been building some basic gems. This gem is designed to quickly set up the folder and file structure I like to use. It uses bundler to create the first layer and then I add a few more things on top.

## Installation

Install the gem from the commmand line:

    $ gem install make_me_a_gem_called

## Usage

Then just run:

    $ make_me_a_gem_called TYPE_GEM_NAME_HERE

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/make_me_a_gem_called/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
